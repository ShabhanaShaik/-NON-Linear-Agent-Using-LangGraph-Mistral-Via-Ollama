# 🤖 Real-Time AI Assistant (Frontend)

A modern and interactive frontend interface for a multi-functional AI assistant powered by real-time WebSocket communication. This project allows users to perform advanced tasks like mathematical problem solving, summarization, translation, and open-ended question answering—all through a clean, responsive UI.

## 🖼️ User Interface Overview

### 🔳 Feature Cards

- Highlights the 4 main capabilities of the assistant.
- Each card includes:
  - A bold title
  - A descriptive subtitle
  - Icon and soft hover effect

### 💬 Example Query Cards

- Quick examples like:
  - "What is the integral of x^2?"
  - "Summarize this paragraph..."
- Clicking a card fills the input box and runs the query.

### ⌨️ Query Input Section

- Input box where users type their question or paste text.
- Keyboard support: Press **Enter** to submit.
- "Clear" button to reset the results and input.

### 🟢 Live Status & Model Indicator

- Displays:
  - WebSocket connection status (🟢 Connected / 🔴 Disconnected)
  - Model or agent name received from backend

### 🧾 Result Cards

- Each result contains:
  - 🔍 Original Query
  - 🤖 AI Response (with typewriter animation)
  - ⚙️ Route Used (e.g., `math`, `translate`, etc.)
  - ⏱️ Processing Time
  - 🕒 Timestamp

🔌 WebSocket Event Flow
This frontend communicates with the backend using socket.io.

Events Emitted to Backend:
query: { query: "your input string" }

Events Listened from Backend:
Event	Description
connect	Socket connected
disconnect	Socket disconnected
status	Backend model/agent info (displayed in UI)
processing	Live status update during query processing
result	Final output from backend, with metadata
error	Error details if something went wrong

🧪 How to Run
Clone or Download this repository.

Open index.html in your browser.

Make sure your backend server is running and supports WebSocket via socket.io.

Start asking questions using the input or example cards!

💡 No local server needed for the frontend—just open the HTML file directly or host it via any static site host (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel).

🛠️ Backend Integration Guide
The backend should:

Use socket.io (Node.js or Python-compatible)

Listen for query event

Emit these events:

status – Send backend model info

processing – Show status updates

result – Send response and metadata

error – Send any issues

Sample emitted result format:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "query": "Translate this to French: Hello",
  "result": "Bonjour",
  "route": "translate",
  "time_taken": "1.24s"
}
⚙️ Customization Options
Update example cards to fit your use-case

Change feature titles/icons/styles as needed

Add voice input, theme switcher, or export buttons

Adapt to your own backend by tweaking socket events
